            <li><a href="http://cw-guide.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">Candidate's Weekend Guide</a> - This web app was my 
                final project for my class Software Design. I collaborate with two fellow classmates to design a web app for our
                college, Olin College of Engineering.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/sd19spring/Death-Rate-Interactive-Map" target="blank">Interactive Map</a> - The 
                interactive map shows the rates of death across the United States. When you hover over a state, a blurb will 
                pop-up with the top ten leading causes of death in the United States and the rates for that particular state.</li>
            <li><a href="https://popup.6seconds.org/" target="blank">Six Seconds POP-UP Festival</a> - As an intern, I used 
                WordPress to build Six Seconds' website for United Nation's World Children's Day. The website is used all across the 
                world to share the importance of emotional intelligence with children and encourage parents to raise their kids with
                an emphasis on emotional awareness.</li>

                Photography Book</a> - In my Advanced Photography class, our semester long project was a photography book. My book is a 
                reflection of my internal struggles with vulnerability and acceptance of who I am. My inspiration for my book was the 
                desire to have stronger connections with others and feel at ease in my own skin, something I have been avoiding since
                a young age.

            <li><a href="http://poe.olin.edu/2019/followbot/" target="blank">FollowBot</a> - Designed and built a robot that
                follows a person. The robots was primarily controlled by an Arduino. The computer vision used to follow a person
                was run on a Raspberry Pi.
