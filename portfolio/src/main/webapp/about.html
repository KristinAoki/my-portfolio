      <p>Welcome and hello! I am a software engineering student at Olin College of Engineering. When the weather is warm and
          sunny you can find me hiking or on a golf course. When the weather isn't so nice, I will be found wrapped in a blanket
          reading a book or watching a romantic comedy. I also enjoy spending my time writing letters to friends and family 
          members. As a result, I have recently picked up the art of calligraphy.
      </p>
      <p>I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and went to North East School of the Arts (NESA). At NESA I dedicated many hours to
          the orchestra, playing the viola for many musicals and concerts. I decided to focus on fine arts in high school 
          instead of tech/engineering because I knew it would be the last time I could really engage with this passion.
      </p>
      <p>I decided to go into the field of engineering because engineers have a solid hand in the future of the world. Without
          engineering we would be a very rudimentary society. I want to use my knowledge to empower people and create a better
          society. I am still unsure how I will accomplish this goal, but it is something I strive towards every day.
      </p>
