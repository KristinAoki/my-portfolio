      <p>Welcome and hello! I am a software engineering student at Olin College of Engineering. When the weather is warm and
          sunny you can find me hiking or on a golf course. When the weather isn't so nice, I will be found wrapped in a blanket
          reading a book or watching a romantic comedy. I also enjoy spending my time writing letters to friends and family 
          members. As a result, I have recently picked up the art of calligraphy.
      </p>
      <p>I grew up in San Antonio, Texas and went to North East School of the Arts (NESA). At NESA I dedicated many hours to
          the orchestra, playing the viola for many musicals and concerts. I decided to focus on fine arts in high school 
          instead of tech/engineering because I knew it would be the last time I could really engage with this passion.
      </p>
      <p>I decided to go into the field of engineering because engineers have a solid hand in the future of the world. Without
          engineering we would be a very rudimentary society. I want to use my knowledge to empower people and create a better
          society. I am still unsure how I will accomplish this goal, but it is something I strive towards every day.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>2018</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="/photography.html">Photography (on going)</a> - One of my passions is photography. I actively began 
          photographying in 2018 when I had my first formal class at college. This is a collection of all the work that I have
          generated since the beginning of that class.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2019</h3>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="http://cw-guide.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">Candidate's Weekend Guide</a> - This web app was my 
            final project for my class Software Design. I collaborate with two fellow classmates to design a web app for our
            college, Olin College of Engineering.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/sd19spring/Death-Rate-Interactive-Map" target="blank">Interactive Map</a> - The 
            interactive map shows the rates of death across the United States. When you hover over a state, a blurb will 
            pop-up with the top ten leading causes of death in the United States and the rates for that particular state.</li>
          <li><a href="https://popup.6seconds.org/" target="blank">Six Seconds POP-UP Festival</a> - As an intern, I used 
            WordPress to build Six Seconds' website for United Nation's World Children's Day. The website is used all across the 
            world to share the importance of emotional intelligence with children and encourage parents to raise their kids with
            an emphasis on emotional awareness.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.blurb.com/bookstore/invited/8456952/5f42afbe2c71b68d858cb8a55f2fd29d0c587a2c" target="blank">
            Photography Book</a> - In my Advanced Photography class, our semester long project was a photography book. My book is a 
              reflection of my internal struggles with vulnerability and acceptance of who I am. My inspiration for my book was the 
              desire to have stronger connections with others and feel at ease in my own skin, something I have been avoiding since
              a young age.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://poe.olin.edu/2019/followbot/" target="blank">FollowBot</a> - Designed and built a robot that
            follows a person. The robots was primarily controlled by an Arduino. The computer vision used to follow a person
            was run on a Raspberry Pi.
